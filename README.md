# ♻️ Data-Driven Waste Management Optimization

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing local waste management practices through data science. It tackles issues such as inefficient waste treatment, low recycling rates, and environmental impact by analyzing real-world data to derive actionable insights and predictive models.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze historical waste treatment data to identify sustainable trends.
- Use clustering to classify dominant waste categories for targeted recycling.
- Compare regional waste practices and understand influencing factors.
- Forecast future waste generation using time series modeling.
- Evaluate performance of waste treatment plants to identify areas for improvement.
- Discover waste reduction opportunities using pattern mining techniques.
