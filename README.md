# ♻️ Data-Driven Waste Management Optimization

## 📌 Project Overview
This project leverages data science to improve local waste management systems. It addresses challenges such as inefficient waste treatment, low recycling rates, and the environmental impact of improper disposal. By analyzing real-world data, the project identifies key patterns, forecasts future waste trends, and proposes actionable improvements.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- 📈 Analyze historical waste generation and treatment trends.
- ♻️ Classify dominant waste categories using clustering.
- 🗺️ Compare regional waste treatment practices and identify influencing factors.
- 🔮 Forecast future waste generation using time series models.
- 🏭 Evaluate facility performance for operational improvement.
- 🔍 Discover waste reduction strategies through pattern mining.

## 🗃️ Dataset
The dataset includes multi-dimensional waste generation data collected over several years:

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Date` | Date of waste collection |
| `Country / Region` | Geographical location |
| `Material` | Waste type (e.g., Organic, Plastic, Metal) |
| `Waste generated` | Quantity of waste (in tons) |


> Data Source: Government open data portals, community datasets, and Kaggle contributions.
